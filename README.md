# AstroNET
An experimental port of the [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) Python library to .NET.

## Coming Soon
Development is still in progress however the code is currently able to reproduce the "[Determining and plotting the altitude/azimuth of a celestial object](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/coordinates/plot_obs-planning.html#sphx-glr-generated-examples-coordinates-plot-obs-planning-py)" example.

## Sounds Interesting?
Say 'hello' and maybe mention what you'd like to see on issue [#1](https://github.com/GregTheDev/AstroNET/issues/1).
